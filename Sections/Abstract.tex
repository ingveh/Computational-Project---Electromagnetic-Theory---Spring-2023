In order to study how charged particles from solar winds interact with the magnetic field of the earth, as seen especially during events of northern lights, we model the earth's magnetic field as that of a pure dipole and numerically solve the equations of motion for incoming charged particles in this field. We then present plots of the trajectories of particles with varying initial conditions, and discuss the nature of the trajectories and how they change with initial conditions. Lastly we discuss the relevance of our findings in the case of actual solar winds.
