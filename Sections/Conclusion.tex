In conclusion, we have used a very simple model in order to simulate the northern light. We approximated the earth's magnetic field by that of a pure magnetic dipole and the solar winds as single protons travelling towards the earth. By numerical solution of the equations of motion for the protons, we found that the protons move in a spiralling trajectory around the earth's center in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field of the earth. Because the magnetic field exerts a force perpendicular to the direction of motion, the field does no work on the particle. This in turn leaves the kinetic energy of the protons constant. Our simulations show how effectively the magnetic field of the earth shields itself from incoming particles by deflecting them. Though our model is a very simplistic compared to reality, it serves to present the essence of how incoming particles interact with the magnetic field of the earth.
